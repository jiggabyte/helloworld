# Development Environment

Firstly, I ensured that Java is installed on my laptop, JDK 17 but you can used openJDK 17 as well. I build an organised code structure in Java style and then place the code in a package while for running the application i used a compile package in the dist folder. Bash shell is used in compiling and running the program.

I used Java and Bash Shell (for running compilation and running the code)
